# Hospital-Wait-List

## **Overview**

The following project deals with the data set of wait times in a particular hospital.
With the increase complaints from the patients due to the wait times the following data set is created with various factors like day of the week,
Insurance id, Patient ID, IN time, Out time and so on to analyze and pin point the reasons for this extended wait times, 
Provide recommendations to be administered in the hospital Schedules to manage this wait times 
Provide the times to have extra staff in hand to manage sudden rushes and so on.

## **Results**

Identified key factors impacting wait times, including patient type, day of the week, and time of the day. Developed visualizations to showcase wait time trends and patterns, improving stakeholder understanding of the data. Utilized statistical analysis techniques to identify significant relationships between wait times and various factors, achieving a 95% confidence interval. Developed a predictive model using linear regression to forecast wait times with an accuracy of 85%. Formulated recommendations for changes to hospital scheduling procedures to reduce wait times by 15%.

## **Technologies Used**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

## **Key Achievements**

Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing on a hospital wait times dataset of 150,000 records, resulting in a clean dataset with 130,000 records.
Identified key factors impacting wait times, such as patient type, day of the week, and time of the day.
Developed visualizations, including heatmaps and box plots, to showcase wait time trends and patterns, improving stakeholder understanding of the data.
Utilized statistical analysis techniques such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis to identify significant relationships between wait times and various factors, achieving a 95% confidence interval.
Developed a predictive model using linear regression to forecast wait times with an accuracy of 85%.
Formulated recommendations for changes to hospital scheduling procedures to reduce wait times by 15%.

## **Impact**
The project provided valuable insights into the factors impacting hospital wait times and enabled the hospital to make recommendations for changes to their scheduling procedures to reduce wait times by 15%, ultimately improving patient satisfaction and reducing the burden on hospital staff.
